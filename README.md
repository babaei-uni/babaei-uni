# Hi there, I'm Hossein Babaei! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile. I'm a passionate student with a strong interest in the intersection of Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Civil Engineering.

## About Me

I'm currently in my final year pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering at the University of Tehran with a GPA of 3 out of 4. While my grades might not be perfect, my academic journey has been a fascinating blend of traditional civil engineering principles and cutting-edge AI technologies. I'm particularly drawn to Reinforcement Learning (RL) and its potential applications in the civil engineering domain.

I'm fortunate to be collaborating with two esteemed professors at the University of Tehran on projects that bridge the gap between civil engineering challenges and machine learning solutions. These experiences are shaping my path towards becoming a Machine Learning Engineer in the field of civil engineering.

## Skills
- **Programming Languages:** Python
- **Machine Learning:** Reinforcement Learning, Deep Learning, hyperparameter tuning, other Machine Learning basic algorithms and concepts, implementation of ML algorithms from scratch
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Keras, Tensorflow, optuna
- **Other:** Git & Github, data structures (hashes, queues, trees, etc.), algorithms, object-oriented programming, databases, Jupyter, optimization, linear algebra, calculus, statistics, probability
- **Languages:** English (working proficiency), Persian (native)

## Collaborations

Collaborating with dedicated professors in the field has given me valuable insights and exposure to real-world challenges. Together, we explore innovative ways to apply AI, particularly RL, to optimize civil engineering processes and decision-making.
